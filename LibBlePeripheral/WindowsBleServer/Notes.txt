How to change Bluetooth adapter discovered name:
On Windows by defualt at least from code its not possible todo!

From windows serttings, atleast on Windows11 you can do:

1. Open Control Panel
2. View devices and printers
3. View More Devices (Settings -> Bluetooth & Devices -> Devices)
4. More Bluetooth Settings (in the bottom)
5. Go to Hardware Tab
6. One of the adapters will have Advanced Tab, with device name (in my case its: Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R))
7. So double click it
8. In Tab: General click Change Settings
9. Go To Advanced Tab
10. Alter Name
11. Save
12. Reboot PC (simple reboot of service/reset of bluettoth doesnt seem to work)

Naming is really important becouse it will be used in order to discover the device later.

You would think that you can use Bluetooth MAC in order to identify the device, yet on each service publishing MAC typically changes!
